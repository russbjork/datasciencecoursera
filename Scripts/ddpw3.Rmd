## Ploty Output

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
defaultW <- getOption("warn") 
options(warn = -1) 
fig <- plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~disp, y = ~mpg, color = ~hp, type = "scatter")
fig
options(warn = defaultW)
```

## Ploty Conclusion

A plot was created using Ploty.  This plot generated MPG by displacement with coloring based on horsepower from the mtcars data.  I hope you enjoyed this very simple presentation of Ploty.
